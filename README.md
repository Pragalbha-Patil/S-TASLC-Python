# S - TASLC

Speech to American Sign language converter.

S - TASLC is developed to help us communicate with the people from the deaf community, thus bridging the gap between us and to encourage conversations without any barricades. I hope this project helps atleast one indiviual who's got their loving ones to communicate with. This project was developed for IoT purpose, but we're trying to eliminate platform dependencies as much as possible and this project will soon be converted to mobile application as well. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install S-TASLC.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

``` 
python3 main.py
